- document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(e) {
	// THE HTML PARSED AND DOM TREE BUILT
})

__This adds an event listener to the document for the DOMContentLoaded event.
__The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, or subframes to finish loading.

- window.addEventListener('load',function(e) {
	// PAGE FULLY LOADED
})

__This adds an event listener for the load event on the window object.
__The load event fires when the entire page is fully loaded, including:
	__The HTML document.
	__All associated resources (stylesheets, images, scripts, iframes, etc.).

- window.addEventListener('beforeunload',function(e) {
	e.preventDefault();
	e.returnValue = ""
})

__ The beforeunload event is triggered when the user is about to leave the page (e.g., closing the tab, refreshing the page, or navigating to another URL).
